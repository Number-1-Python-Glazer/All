Password Strength Checker  

OVERVIEW  
The tool examines passwords to detect their common security vulnerabilities. The system evaluates password strength through three criteria which include password length and the presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. The system displays all detected problems.
  
GOAL
I aim to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental password policy requirements,.


PROCESS
The program requests a password from the user.
The system verifies that the password contains  fewer than eight characters.
The system verifies that all characters in the password exist in lowercase form.
The system verifies that all characters in the password exist in uppercase form.
The system verifies that the password contains no numerical characters. 
The system creates a collection of detected problems.
The password meets all requirements when the list remains empty,  
The system displays each problem when the list contains entries.

WHY THIS MATTERS IN CYBER
The use of weak passwords leads to actual security breaches,
Security teams perform checks to verify password complexity ruless.
The project demonstrates my ability to understand fundamental password security principles and basic validation techniques.
